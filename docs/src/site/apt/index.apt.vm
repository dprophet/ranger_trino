Apache Ranger&#8482;

 Apache Ranger&#8482; is a framework to enable, monitor and manage comprehensive data security across the Hadoop platform.

 The vision with Ranger is to provide comprehensive security across the Apache Hadoop ecosystem. With the advent of  Apache YARN, the Hadoop platform can now support a true data lake architecture. Enterprises can potentially run multiple workloads, in a multi tenant environment. Data security within Hadoop needs to evolve to support multiple use cases for data access, while also providing a framework for central administration of security policies and monitoring of user access.

 Please read the {{{./faq.html}FAQs}} if you need to understand how it works over Apache Hadoop components.

* Goals Overview

   Apache Ranger has the following goals:

   * Centralized security administration to manage all security related tasks in a central UI or using REST APIs.

   * Fine grained authorization to do a specific action and/or operation with Hadoop component/tool and managed through a central administration tool

   * Standardize authorization method across all Hadoop components.

   * Enhanced support for different authorization methods - Role based access control, attribute based access control etc.

   * Centralize auditing of user access and administrative actions (security related) within all the components of Hadoop.


* Usage

  General instructions on how to use the Apache Ranger can be found on the {{{https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/RANGER/Index}Wiki Page}}.
